### Local Development

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   cd forum
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Download and install the necessary Go modules:

3. **Database Setup**  
   Use the following commands to manage the database schema:

   - **Create the Database Schema**  
     This command initializes the database schema:
     ```bash

     ```

   - **Create the Database Schema with Demo Data**  
     This command initializes the schema and populates it with sample data:
     ```bash
     go run . --seed
     ```

   - **Drop the Database Schema**  
     This command drops all tables from the database:
     ```bash
     go run . --drop
     ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   Start the application from the `cmd` directory:
   ```bash
   cd cmd
   go run .
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`
